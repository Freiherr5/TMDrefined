# TMDrefined


Purpose
_______
Biochemical/Bioinformatics application
TMDrefined is a simple application for transmembrane domain (TMD) start and stop position redefinition.


Description
___________
It was designed as a result of high heterogeneity of predictions between state of the art
protein primary sequence annotation softwares.

It tries to learn from the patterns of the combined predictions of these softwares and refine the 
TMD annotation of an initial guess (e.g. via UniProt) based on the learned consensus of an ensemble of
annotation softwares.


Note
____
This is still an early prototype.
