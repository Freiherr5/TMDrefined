# TMDrefined


---
### Purpose 

Bioinformatics application
TMDrefined is a simple application for transmembrane domain (TMD) start and stop position re-definition.

---
### Description

It was designed as a result of the high heterogeneity of predictions between state-of-the-art
annotation-softwares.

It attempts to learn from the patterns of the combined annotation-software predictions and refine the 
TMD-annotation of an initial guess (e.g. via UniProt).

---
### Note

This is still an early prototype.
A rework of the algorithms structure and its hyperparameter optimization is planned
